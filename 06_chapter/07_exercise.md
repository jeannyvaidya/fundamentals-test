Now things are starting to heat up! We'll be taking a short break from our contacts book to get some practice iterating over arrays. 

Instructions

1. Open a new session in [repl.it](https://repl.it/).
2. Write the code to perform the actions listed below, using repl.it's editor window.
3. Click 'play' to run the code.
4. Call each function from the console window. Try using different parameters to make sure they're working properly.

### Let's get started!

#### Part 1

1. Create an array `cups` containing numbers 1 - 10.
2. Create an empty array `ounces`.
3. Write a function `convertToOunces`. It should iterate through the cups array, convert each item from cups to ounces, and then add that item to the ounces array. Return the value of ounces after looping through the items and before the function ends.

#### Part 2

1. Create an array `scores` containing the numbers 83, 40, 55, 72, 59, 88, and 99.
2. Write a function `passOrFail`. It should loop through the scores array and replace the current item with 'pass' if the score is greater than or equal to 60 and 'fail' if the score is less than 60. Return the scores array.
