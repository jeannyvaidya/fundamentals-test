# TEXT EDITORS AND WEB BROWSERS
## How the Web Works


In this video, we’ll learn about the tools we use to build and view websites. The web can be a pretty intimidating place, so you may be worried that you’ll need to master some really complicated programs just to get started.

Fortunately, that isn’t the case. The two tools we’re going to use in this class — text editors and web browsers — will be surprisingly familiar and easy to master.

Our first tool is the text editor.

We write and edit all of our HTML and CSS files using text editors. You might be wondering, “Why do I need a special program for this? Why can’t I just use a word processor, like Microsoft Word, or Google Docs, or even a simple notepad program?”

Well, those are really good questions; however, there’s an important reason that we use text editors instead of those other options. Text editors produce plain text files, meaning that they have zero formatting.

Word processors may look like they don’t have any special formatting; however, they often have hidden features affecting the layout and arrangement of text on the screen. If this hidden formatting information touches your HTML or CSS, it might not work properly. Thus, we use a text editor. Luckily there are some pretty great text editors available for free online.

The text editor we will be using in this course is Sublime Text. Sublime is one of the most popular text editors available, and it’s used by developers of all stages, from beginner to expert. It’s free, easy to use, and has a number of helpful features. Watch our video about Sublime if you’d like to know how to download it and how to employ some tips and tricks to get the most out of it.

And that’s a basic introduction to how the web works. Don’t worry if you still have questions. We’ll review some of the terms in our Tech Speak video section, and your mentor can help with any further questions you have.
