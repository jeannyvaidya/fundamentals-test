We've gone ahead and created a new directory for you, called <em>World</em>. Download it <a href="http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/assets/activity/World.zip">here</a>.

When you double-click on the zip file, it will create a new folder next to the zip file in your Downloads folder.

Now that you can picture where the file is located, open the Terminal application

Using the command line alone,

1. Navigate into your `Downloads` directory 

2. Move into the `World` directory from the `Downloads` directory

3. List the contents of the `World` directory

4. In one of the six continents within the `World` directory is a hidden file, `.carmen_sandiego.png`.  Using only the command line, find out where in the World is Carmen Sandiego.
