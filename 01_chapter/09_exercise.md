Part 1: 

1. Open up the terminal application

2. Navigate into your Downloads directory

3. Move the World directory from Downloads to your home directory

4. Check to see if you successfully moved the World directory by listing the contents of your home directory

Part 2: 

You may have noticed that we neglected to include Antarctica in the `World` directory. Go ahead and correct this mistake straight from command line:

1. Make sure you're in the `World` directory within your home directory

2. Make a new directory titled "Antarctica" inside the `World` directory

3. To be sure you created the directory in the right place, list the contents of the `World` directory

4. If you haven't already, change back into the `World` directory

5. List the contents of `South_America`. There should be three country directories, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.

7. Move the contents of `South_America` into the `North_America` folder

8. Delete the now empty `South_America` directory

9. Change the name of `North_America` to `Americas`
