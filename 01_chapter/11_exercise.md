Now it's your turn to get some practice writing pseudo code! 

#### Program: Eligible for a Discount?

We'd like to create a program that checks to see whether movie patrons are eligible for a discount and displays the appropriate ticket price.

Here is the pricing structure:

1. If a patron is 65 or over they are eligible for a senior discount. The ticket price for seniors is $6.00.

2. If a patron is under 25 they are eligible for a student discount. The ticket price for students is $8.00.

3. All other tickets cost $10.00.

Try your hand at writing pseudo code for this program. Remember, the goal is to think through the problem and break it down into simple steps.
